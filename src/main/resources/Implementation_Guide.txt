*Before writing code, check the Common git&github update cycle image provided in the discord group channel.

*Write your codes in your own branch.

*Main responsibility for all developers is implementing all CRUD methods successfully.

*We are going to have two important branch dev and test other than master.

*We are going to merge our codes first in the dev branch, after review. (for the dev branch we should ask for 1 reviewer).

*Do not merge anything to the test branch. It will be explained later.

*How to create implementation classes and methods?

        Example:
            public class CourseService implements CRUDService<Course> {
                @Override
                public Course findById(int id) {
                    return Database.courseList.stream()
                            .filter(course -> course.id == id)
                            .findFirst().orElseThrow();
                }
            }

*After you created your methods you can test your methods. It will be explained.

*Branch management and merging process is important. Pay attention.

*Whenever you need any help, do not hesitate to reach me.

*YOU KNOW THE SCHOOLMAINRUNNER class is a common class that you can check your methods inside that class in main method.
But please uncheck your SchoolMainRunner class when you commit and push your codes to dev remote branch!!!!!!!
